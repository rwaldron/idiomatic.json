## Know JSON

JSON has a simple spec. Learn it.

The spec has some useful terminology. Objects have *pairs* and Arrays have *elements*.

## Idiomatic Style Guide

1. <a name="key-names">Key Names</a>
    - Know the different word separation styles. Common ones include lowerCamelCase,
      snake_case, dash-case, and UpperCamelCase.
    - lowerCamelCase is a good choice, since it's the default in JavaScript, and other popular 
      client-side languages, like Android and Objective C. It's better to have
      server-side developers handle differences in word separation styles than to
      leave that job up to client-side developers.
    - Don't mix different word separation styles in the same document. If you are working on an
      existing application and want to change the word separation style, change it quickly or
      not at all.
    - If you need to use json keys in urls and xml tags and attribute names, find a library that
      converts from lowerCamelCase to dash-case, and from dash-case to lowerCamelCase. If you do
      this a lot, consider using dash-case.
    - Use the same id key across an application (`id` and `_id` are popular choices for key names)

2. <a name="types">Extra Types</a>
    - JSON comes with a few simple types. Often applications need other types, like dates and
      symbols. It's also useful to note
    - Types for the most part should be contextually defined. If you need to store values of two
      different types, consider using different key names.
    - When you need to have a mix of things of different types, have a clear and obvious way of
      differentiating between types.
    - If the rules for types are complex, specify the types explicitly in the JSON, by wrapping
      values in objects, and using a pair to specify the type. For instance, if you had an array
      with dollars and pounds as strings, you might convert them from `["Â£8", "$15"]` to 
      `[{"type": "pounds", "value": 8}, {"type": "dollars", value: 15}]`.

3. <a name="dates">Dates</a>
    - Use ISO dates or UNIX timestamps for dates
    - Avoid unusual formats like the [ASP.net AJAX format](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb299886.aspx#intro_to_json_sidebarb).

4. <a name="sets">Sets</a>
    - A set is like a JSON object (also called a hash) but with no values; only the keys.
    - There is no set type in JSON.
    - Arrays and objects are commonly used as sets. Be consistent in which you use. If you use
      objects, be consistent in what you use for the values.
    - If you're building an API and want it to be quick to read, a list may be the most
      intuitive. An example is tags for a blog post. `["programming", "json"]` reads easier
      than `{"programming": true, "json": true}`.
    - The object is more efficient when you're actually doing something with a set, but sometimes
      sets are moved around unmodified. For this a list will be more efficient.

5. <a name="complex-types">Complex Types</a>
    - A complex type is something like a location (latitude and longitude) or a link (text and url)
      that might take up two pairs in an object.
